# Basic non-visual elements for Polymer.dart

A port of polymer.js' [core-elements](http://polymer.github.io/core-docs/) to Polymer.dart. 
The intent of the authors is to contribute the work to the Dart project itself (https://www.dartlang.org).

### Dart ports of Polymer elements from [PolymerLabs](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/polymer-elements.html) can be found at 
* [polymer_elements](https://github.com/ErikGrimes/polymer_elements)
* [polymer_ui_elements](https://github.com/ErikGrimes/polymer_ui_elements)


## Documentation
* The Dart source files of an element often contain some documentation (Dartdoc) how to use the element. You can also find this documentation online at  
* [DartDoc](http://bwu-dart.github.io/core_elements/docs/index.html)
* Almost each element has an associated demo page which shows how to use the element. 
Open the 'demo' links below to take a look.
The source code of these demo pages can be found in the [example subdirectory of the package](https://github.com/ErikGrimes/polymer_elements/tree/master/example). 
The actual implementation of the demo page is often outsourced to files in the `example/src/element_name` subdirectory.


## Usage
* add the following to your pubspec.yaml file: 

```yaml
dependencies:
  core_elements:
```
For more details take a look at the demo pages. 

## Feedback

Your feedback is very much appreciated. We are excited to hear about your experience using polymer_elements.
We need your feedback to continually improve the qualtiy.

- Please let us know which components we should prioritize. Just add a comment to #3


## General notes

* Tested with Dart SDK version 1.4.0-dev.6.5

### Status
<!-- (A few demo pages (* aren't rendered properly as GitHub Pages or because they use unfinished elements. We are working on it.) --> 

<!-- * Status `(ported)` means it is ported but not yet usable -->
